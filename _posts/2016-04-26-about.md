Blog
----
This is a personal blog that I mostly just use as a reference for myself. I try to write about things I would want to read. If it ever sounds like I know what I am talking about, I don't.

Personal
--------
I live in Tallahassee, FL with my girlfriend and our two dogs, [Swiffer](https://www.graysonskent.com/assets/images/swiffer.jpg) and [Peeps](https://www.graysonskent.com/assets/images/peeps.JPG). I enjoy FPV Drone Racing, Mountain Biking, Photography, and Hiking.

Design Philosophy
-----------------
The [UNIX Philosophy](http://wiki.c2.com/?UnixDesignPhilosophy) mixed with [Specification by example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example) like in the D3.js project. 

I spent a lot of my childhood in the school basement with the UNIX admins, so I will always keep those ideals at heart.
