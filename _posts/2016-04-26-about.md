Professional
------------
I have had many titles, but currently I work as a **Systems Engineer** at [Corporation Services Company](https://www.cscglobal.com/service/cls/real-estate-recording-services), who manages Real Estate transactions for 90% of the Fortune 500.

Blog
----
This is a personal blog that I mostly just use as a reference for myself. I try to write about things I would want to read. If it ever sounds like I know what I am talking about, it's probably wrong.

Personal
--------
I live in Tallahassee, FL with my girlfriend and our two dogs, [Swiffer](https://www.graysonskent.com/assets/images/swiffer.jpg) and [Peeps](https://www.graysonskent.com/assets/images/peeps.JPG). I enjoy FPV Drone Racing, Mountain Biking, Photography, and Hiking.

Design Philosophy
-----------------
Essentially just the [UNIX Philosophy](http://wiki.c2.com/?UnixDesignPhilosophy) mixed with [Specification by example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example) like in the D3.js project. 

I used to skip school to hang out with the UNIX admins in the basement, so at heart I will always try to keep those ideals alive while working with newer technologies.
