Professional
------------
I have had many titles, but currently I work as a **Systems Engineer** at [Corporation Services Company](https://www.cscglobal.com/service/cls/real-estate-recording-services).

I also do some consulting work. Mainly code review for books or technical interview questions.

Blog
----
This is a personal blog that I mostly use as a reference for myself. I try to write about things I would want to read and I am always happy to hear about new blog ideas, or any way I could improve my posts.

I try to clearly indicate when I am presenting a sub-optimal solution, like when I am [code-golfing](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/) or have [some specific restriction](https://grayson.sh/blog/fizzbuzz-in-bash-no-modulus), but please still take my solutions with a grain of salt.  Most of them I would never use in a professional setting as [they are more so clever than they are simple and reusable](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/25276/why-is-cleverness-considered-harmful-in-programming-by-some-people/25281).

Personal
--------
I live in Tallahassee, FL with my girlfriend and our two dogs, [Swiffer](https://grayson.sh/assets/images/swiffer.jpg) and [Peeps](https://grayson.sh/assets/images/peeps2.JPEG). We also have two birds and a blind cat named [Stevie](https://grayson.sh/assets/images/stevie.JPEG) in our zoo of a house. [Here they are altogether](https://grayson.sh/assets/images/family.JPEG).

I enjoy Macro Photography, breaking "smart" products, customizing mechanical keyboards, and getting into internet arguments on Linux/Bash minutiae.

Design Philosophy
-----------------
The [UNIX Philosophy](http://wiki.c2.com/?UnixDesignPhilosophy) mixed with [Specification by example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example) like the D3.js project.
