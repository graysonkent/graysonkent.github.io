Blog

This is a personal blog that I mostly use as a reference for myself. I write on Linux, Security, Networking, and Virtualization because that is what I do all day, but I will also post Data Visualizations and fun projects from time to time.

Personal
--------
I live in Tallahassee, FL with my girlfriend and our two dogs, [Swiffer](https://www.graysonskent.com/images/swiffer.jpg) and [Peeps](https://www.graysonskent.com/images/peeps.jpg). I enjoy FPV Drone Racing, Mountain Biking, Photography, and exploiting IoT Devices.

Design Philosophy
-----------------
Essentially just the [UNIX Philosophy](http://wiki.c2.com/?UnixDesignPhilosophy) mixed with [Specification by example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_by_example) like in the D3.js project, and virtually anything Donald Knuth says, but especially making sure to avoid [Premature Optimization](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization).
