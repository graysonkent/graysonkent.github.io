Blog
------
This is a personal blog that I mostly use as a reference for myself. I try to write about things I would want to read and I am always happy to hear about new blog ideas, or any way I could improve my posts.

My main topics of interest are broadly Linux, Security, Networking, and Virtualization. Look at my [Archive](/archive) for a full list of blog posts.

### Disclaimer

I try to clearly indicate when I am presenting a sub-optimal solution, like when I am [code-golfing](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/) or have [some specific restriction](https://grayson.sh/blog/fizzbuzz-in-bash-no-modulus), but please still take my solutions with a grain of salt. I would never use most of these examples in a professional setting as [they are more so clever than they are simple and reusable](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/25276/why-is-cleverness-considered-harmful-in-programming-by-some-people/25281).


Professional
-----------------
I have had many titles, but currently I work as a **Systems Engineer** at [Corporation Services Company](https://www.cscglobal.com/cscglobal/home/).

I also do some consulting work. Mainly code review for books or reviewing technical interview questions. Feel free to email me if you think I would be a good fit for something you are working on. I love to help out on interesting projects any way I can.


Personal
------------
I live in Tallahassee, FL with my girlfriend and our zoo of a house. It is easier to just list all of our animals:

 - [Swiffer](../assets/images/swiffer.jpg) is a [Yorkipoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkipoo) and our craziest dog
 - [Peeps](../assets/images/peeps2.jpeg) is a sweetheart [Cavachon](http://dogs.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Cavachon) dog
 - [Calvin](../assets/images/calvin.jpg) is a very easily frightened Cockatiel
 - [Charlotte](../assets/images/charlotte.jpeg) is a ferocious Parakeet
 - [Kiva](../assets/images/kiva.jpeg) is a [Green Cheek Conure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green-cheeked_parakeet) who now rules my mother's house
 - Too many fish and shrimp to count

[Here are all the mammals together](../assets/images/family.jpeg).

Hobbies
-----------
I enjoy macro photography and hiking, breaking "smart" products, Racquetball/Handball, and arguing about Linux & Bash minutiae.
