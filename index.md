Blog
------
This is a personal blog where I try to write about things I would want to read. 
My main topics of interest are Linux, Security, Networking, and Virtualization. Look at my [archive](/archive) for a full list of blog posts.


Professional
-----------------
I currently work as a **Linux Systems Engineer** at [The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory](https://nationalmaglab.org/), home to the world's largest magnet.

I also do some consulting work. Usually code review for books or creating technical interview questions. Feel free to email me if you think I would be a good fit for something you are working on. 

Personal
------------
I enjoy mountain biking, racquetball, disc golf, and writing about Linux & Bash minutiae.
