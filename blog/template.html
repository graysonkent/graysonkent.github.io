			<h2> How to Insert new directory </h2>
			
			<p>
				See the big difference? The <abbr>CSPRNG</abbr>
				is not running alongside the
				random number generator, filling in for those times when
				/dev/urandom wants to output something, but has nothing good to
				output. The <abbr>CSPRNG</abbr>
				is an integral part of the random number
				generation process. There is no /dev/random handing out “good and
				pure” random numbers straight from the whitener. Every randomness
				source's input is thoroughly mixed and hashed inside the
				<abbr>CSPRNG</abbr>,
				before it emerges as random numbers, either via /dev/urandom
				or /dev/random.
			</p>
			<p id="estimate">
				Another important difference is that there is no entropy <em>counting</em>
				going on here, but <em>estimation</em>. The amount of entropy some source
				is giving you isn't something obvious that you just get, along with
				the data. It has to be estimated. Please note that when your estimate
				is too optimistic, the dearly held property of /dev/random, that it's
				only giving out as many random numbers as available entropy allows,
				is gone. Unfortunately, it's hard to estimate the amount of entropy.
