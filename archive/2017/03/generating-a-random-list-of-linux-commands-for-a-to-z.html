			<h2>Generating a random list of Linux commands for A-Z <span class="date">3/26/2017</span></h2>
					<p>I was out at lunch with a friend who has been interviewing for Senior Linux Engineer positions, and he mentioned one of the interview problems he had was to "Write down a list of Linux commands for each letter in the alphabet"</p>
					<p>Pretty easy for someone with 20+ years experience, but the interesting aspect to this question was that they said they asked this because "It was impossible to program out an answer"</p>
					<p>I was immediately skeptical as there has been very few things I haven't been able to <i>eventually</i> script out.</p>
					<p>Sure enough, it was a very simple one-liner when I remembered the <span class="highlight"><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion-Builtins.html">compgen</a></span> built-in:</p>
					
					<pre class="brush: bash">
					for i in {a..z}; do compgen -c "$i" | shuf -n 1; done
</pre>				
				<p>Will generate a random list of commands A-Z. For one example:</p>
									<pre class="brush: bash">
apt-cdrom
bluez-test-audio
cpgr
dmsetup
expr
from
gnome-thumbnail-font
hpljP1007
iptables-xml
jockey-text
koi8rxterm
lodraw
mcomp
nm-tool
orca
pod2text
quote_readline
readlink
sleep
totem-video-indexer
ucfq
validlocale
wmctrl
xzcat
yelp
zgrep									
</pre>
											<p>I would have preferred to stick to only built-ins, but you wouldn't have been able to complete the problem that way:</p>
					<pre class="brush: bash">
$ for i in {a..z}; do compgen -b "$i" | shuf -n 1; done
alias
bind
cd
disown
export
fg
getopts
hash
jobs
kill
local
mapfile
popd
read
shift
trap
unalias
wait
</pre>						
<p>So apparently there are no built-ins starting with "I,N,O,Q,V,X,Y,Z". Now <i>that</i> would have been a hard interview question.</p>
